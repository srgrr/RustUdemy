# RustUdemy

This repo contains all the activities, exercises, notes, programs and scripts I wrote while learning Rust.

I followed the following course:

Ultimate Rust Crash Course

Through IBM's "IBM learning" platform, although the course itself is hosted, and most likely available, in vanilla Udemy too.

# Safety, Concurrency and Speed

The course presents a "three-options-pick-two" kind of triangle.

Python is Safe and Concurrent, but does not offer Speed
C/C++ offers Speed and Concurrency, but it is not Safe (due to wild memory management basically)

Rust intends to cover these three vertices at once.

# Repo with exercises

This course includes a repo with exercises. I've downloaded it and added it as a submodule here. The repo is named ultimate_rust_crash_course.git
